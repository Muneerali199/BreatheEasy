# **App Name**: BreatheEasy

## Core Features:

- 3D Air Quality Globe: Display real-time air quality data (AQI, pollutant levels) with a 3D globe visualization of air quality worldwide, using a color-coded system that adjusts with zoom level.
- Air Quality Forecasting: Forecast air quality for specific locations using a pre-trained AI model and display the information using sparklines.  The LLM should function as a tool, assessing location information to adjust model weighting factors.
- Location Management & Dashboard: Allow users to set preferred locations (using autocompleted type-ahead) for quick access, and display a summary dashboard using custom 3D icons for different air quality levels. 3D globe persists across navigation.
- Customizable Notifications: Enable customizable push notifications for poor air quality based on user-defined thresholds. The LLM will function as a tool to help define useful notification strategies.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#42A5F5), evoking a sense of clean air and clarity.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5), providing a clean and unobtrusive backdrop that allows the air quality data and visualizations to stand out. Use a light color scheme.
- Accent color: Lime green (#A5D6A7), to highlight improvements in air quality and important interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif known for its modern and neutral appearance, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use custom-designed 3D icons to represent different air quality levels, matching the color scheme and adding depth and visual interest. Favor icons that convey information at a glance.
- Incorporate subtle animations on the 3D globe for transitions and data updates, enhancing the user experience without overwhelming the interface.
- Employ a layered design approach to convey depth, leveraging light and shadow to create a 3D aesthetic. This will bring visual richness and engagement.
