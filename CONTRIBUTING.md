## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs or Suggesting Features

The best way to contribute is by opening an issue. If you've found a bug or have an idea for a new feature, please check the existing issues first to see if it has already been discussed. If not, feel free to open a new issue.

When reporting a bug, please include:
- A clear and descriptive title.
- A detailed description of the problem.
- Steps to reproduce the bug.
- Any relevant screenshots or error messages.
